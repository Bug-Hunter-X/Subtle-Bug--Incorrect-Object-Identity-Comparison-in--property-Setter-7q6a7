The corrected version of the setter method uses `isEqualToString:` to compare the contents of the strings rather than `!=`:

```objectivec
- (void)setMyString:(NSString *)newString {
    if (![newString isEqualToString:_myString]) {
        _myString = [newString copy];
    }
}
```

This ensures that the copy is made only if the contents of the strings are different, preventing the potential bug described above.  This also handles the case where `newString` is `nil`.  It will correctly replace the previous value without any issues.
